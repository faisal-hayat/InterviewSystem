## What is SOLID

- SOLId is set of rules or principles which are used to cerate scaleable, maintainable, and scalable software solutions.
- Design pattersn solve a certain kind of problem to design software solutions.
- SOLID stands for 
  1. single responsibility principle
  2. open/closed principle
  3. Liskov Substitution principle
  4. Interface segregation principle
  5. Dependency inversion principle

## Single responsibility principle

- class should have only one single responsibility and only one reason to be changed

--- ---

## Open/closed principle

- class should be open for modification but closed for modification
- SRP is pre-requisite for open/close principle

--- ---

## Interface Segregation

- A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use
- it is better to have small interfaces inseatd of one large interface

--- ---

## Liskov Substitution principle

- Object of cild class must be able to replace object of parent class without breaking the application.

--- ---

## Dependency inversion principle

- A high level class must not depend on low level class.
